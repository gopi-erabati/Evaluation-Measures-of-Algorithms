# Evaluation-Measures-of-Algorithms

In Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD), the role of classifier is to properly classify each object instance to a particular class. So, this is the step of decision making and it leads to very significant effects on diagnosis. So, evaluation of these decision making algorithms becomes vital in the process. The performance of a classifier is analyzed by ROC analysis or by measuring the cluster distances. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) play a significant role in algorithm evaluation. ROC curves also proved useful for the evaluation of machine learning techniques, in comparing and evaluating different classification algorithms. A ROC graph is a technique for visualizing, organizing and selecting classifiers based on their performance.
