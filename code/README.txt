To run the ROC Curves

1. Make this folder as current working directory of your MATLAB.
2. run 'main.m' file to get ROC curves of all algorithms and all images.
	
To compute Jaccard index 

1. Make this folder as current working directory of your MATLAB.
2. run 'jaccardindex.m' file to evaluate jaccard index of all algorithms and all images.

To compute Dice index 

1. Make this folder as current working directory of your MATLAB.
2. run 'diceindex.m' file to evaluate dice index of all algorithms and all images.

To compute Hausdorff distance

1. Make this folder as current working directory of your MATLAB.
2. run 'hausdrofdist.m' file to evaluate haussdorff distance of all algorithms and all images.
3. run 'main_Haussdorf.m' to evaluate hausdorff distance of single images given a threshold.

The remaining files are for supporting function to compute the above.

Cheers!
